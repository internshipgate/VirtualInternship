Project Name: Website Blocker

Introduction:  
we are going to build a real-time most popular python application known as website blocker.
This application can be used to block the websites so that the user can not open them during the specific period.
Let's discuss how can we build such an application by using python.


Objective
The objective of Python website blocker is to block some certain websites which can distract the user during the specified amount of time.


Process
To block the access to a specific website on the computer, we need to configure the hosts file.
Location of hosts file
The location of the hosts file varies from operating system to operating system.
Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
mac and Linux: /etc/hosts


Requirements
We need to know the following python modules to build the python website blocker.
	1. file handling: file handling is used to do the modifications to the hosts file.
	2. time: The time module is used to control the frequency of the modifications to the hosts file.
	3. datetime: The datetime module is used to keep track of the free time and working time.
